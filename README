2022-02-07: Creating this folder to organize development of stacors and stxcors

Starting by just pulling in the various versions we have. Some from Users/Sarah/Code, some from
my xcor_sandbox (buried in one of Jenny's data folders).


Dependency evaluation:
Depends on crosspairs/closepairs and/or binned versions (preferable)
Depends on the structure of the imagestruct and the record
--for timing, which it gets all the way from the "timestamp" metadata file
--for the fact that multiple masks are expected, where data is stored, etc.

Main goal to improve this:
.Make it clear what the window is in the time dimension. How is it inferred from the times?
.Then compute the duration_excl_gaps correctly
.Make absolutely sure that the mask direction comparison is the same as the points. This
matters in the time edge correction.

Incidental ways that the code could be improved. Don't do these unless they make the main goal
substantially easier:
.separate out a single function that takes points and a (pair of) masks, returns their (cross-)
correlation function. Possibly also pass in some options (e.g. unif in time or not).
.replace crosspairs with a binned version (which may need to be written)


Incidental features to potentially add:
.Different kinds of mask
.mask1 different from mask 2
.More generalized arg handling to enable adding features later

Plan:
x1. Commit the most recent good versions
2. Simple testing framework that just checks that you get the same result as the old code.
3. Separate code that actually computes the correlation from the code that handles the input
formats. Without changing the algo.
